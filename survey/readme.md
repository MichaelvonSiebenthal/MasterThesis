# Self-Made Survey

This folder contains the data of the self-made survey and the code used for the 
analysis. This folder contains following files:

1. The csv files "Kenntnisse und Einstellungen im Finanzbereich" and 
    "Attitudes and Knowledge Regarding Finance" contain the survey responses. The 
    files are separate as the survey was conducted in German and in English in order
    to reach as many respondent as possible. The responses were collected using 
    Google forms and the row headers contain the questions and the answers below.

2. The survey_impl.ipynb file contains the model implementations and analyses of 
    self-made survey. 

Due to the small sample size of only n=113 responses, this dataset cannot be considered
for any serious analysis and machine learning task. It however sparked the question of 
whether stochastic or deterministic MAG graphs should be created. Given the limited use 
of the dataset due to its small size, the dataset is only analyzed to a minimum extent.
