  The analysis of the data in chapter \ref{section:data} and the presentation
  of the machine learning results in chapter \ref{section:results} provided a
  myriad of interesting results. These results primarily touch following topics
  and provide the structure for the discussion:

  \begin{enumerate}
      \item Informativeness of semi-synthetic graphs
      \item Appropriateness of semi-synthetic graphs for machine learning
      \item Graph machine learning versus standard machine learning 
  \end{enumerate}

  \section{Informativeness of Semi-Synthetic Graphs}
  
  The graph generated for the US Airline Passenger data set presented in section
  \ref{section:airline_data} provided interesting results for cluster analysis. 
  The MAG model was successfully used for generating a graph that captured 
  useful neighborhood structures as shown in figure \ref{fig:us_airline_nodes}. 
  Specifically, similar nodes were grouped together based on their similarity 
  given the selected attributes for the MAG model. Especially appealing is that 
  neighborhoods are also consistent within neighborhoods. To illustrate this, 
  one can observe that all nodes are clustered together based on their 
  similarity even within the two main clusters which formed based on the 
  attribute type of travel. This observation is consistent for several 
  additional levels. For instance, nodes form neighborhoods based on age within 
  the cluster of business class passengers which is part of the cluster of 
  passenger which are traveling for business purposes. The only attribute for 
  which no significant clusters emerged is the attribute gender. The reason for 
  this is, that the link-affinity matrix formed a connection with probability 
  of 0.6 for observations with the same gender and 0.4 if they were of the 
  opposite gender. These probabilities were set based on the assumption that
  observations of the same gender are more similar than the opposite gender. It
  is however not assumed, that the passenger experience for women would be
  significantly different to the one for men. In addition, one needs to be
  careful when assigning link-affinity probabilities. The data is almost
  perfectly 50/50 split into male and female observations. If one assigns very
  low- or high probabilities, this will significantly alter the graph. This is 
  for instance done for the attribute type of travel which split the graph into
  the two main clusters. This aspect is less of a concern for attributes with 
  multiple categories such as age. Nevertheless, the attribute gender did 
  generate some mild clustering within the network, which could be exploited for 
  graph machine learning. One can observe this mild clustering in the graph, the 
  effect is however not pronounced enough to draw any conclusions from visual 
  observations. The graphs shown in figure \ref{fig:us_airline_nodes} thus 
  provide very useful insights for better understanding the relationships within 
  the data. This is a welcome bi-product of the MAG model and it is surprising 
  to see how informative the resulting graph is for analyzing the data. In fact, 
  it provides vastly superior insights compared to what a standard scatter plot 
  can reveal given the available feature data. For reference, the pairplot of 
  the feature data can be found in appendix \ref{App:pairplot}. In this regard, 
  the MAG model is very exciting for visually analyzing data. \\

  \noindent Applying methods such as Node2Vec further allows for the creation
  of 2-dimensional node embeddings which can be used to create scatter plots. The
  scatter plots shown figure \ref{fig:node2vec} show the node embeddings of the
  graph shown in figure \ref{fig:us_airline_nodes}. The scatter plot further
  helps to solidify the insights gained from the graph. A limitation of the
  graph for visual interpretation is, that one technically would need to
  consider the node connections. The large size of the graph however makes it
  impossible to visually follow the node connections for interpretation. Node2Vec
  considers the node connections/edges of the network and removes the mentioned
  limitation for visually interpreting the graph. Figure \ref{fig:node2vec}
  shows, that the visual insights gained from the graph are still valid after
  considering the node connections. The Node2Vec algorithm is a beautiful
  dimensionality reduction technique, which successfully reduced the complexity
  of the graph shown in figures \ref{fig:us_airline_graph} \& 
  \ref{fig:us_airline_nodes}. In this sense, the MAG model in combination with
  Graph Representation Learning such as Node2Vec can be used as powerful
  cluster analysis tools.
  
  \section{Appropriateness of Semi-Synthetic Graphs for Machine Learning}
  \label{section:gml_performance}

  The discussion in the previous section shows, that semi-synthetic graphs
  themselves can provide valuable visual insights. In this section it is
  discussed to what extent semi-synthetic graphs are appropriate for graph
  machine learning. The perhaps most instructive evidence is provided by the Bank
  Telemarketing data set presented in section \ref{section:bank_data}. Graph
  machine learning fails to perform well on the graph generated from this
  dataset. It is shown, that the attributes chosen for the MAG model are
  unsuccessful for generating network structures that provided useful additional
  information which then could be exploited using graph machine learning. The 
  Bank Telemarketing dataset is notoriously difficult due to the unbalanced
  distribution of the label. The dataset consist of approximately 90\% of
  observations which did not invest in the short-term deposit compared to only 
  10\% of the observations which did invest. For graph machine learning and
  also the standard machine learning methods, it is loss optimizing to
  classify most if not all observations as non-investors. When generating the
  biased graph shown in figure \ref{fig:Moro_bias}, a classification accuracy
  of > 95\% is achieved which is a remarkable improvement. As mentioned in 
  section \ref{section:bank_data}, the biased graph which includes the label
  as an attribute cannot be used in a practical setting and is a form of
  cheating. Nevertheless it shows, that if a network structure can be generated
  which captures the label well, the problem of unbalanced label data can be
  overcome. In particular it shows, that the attributes must be capable of
  generating network structures that are at least in part predictive of the
  label. This is an interesting topic and warrants further research, as
  overcoming the problem presented by unbalanced label data is a relevant issue
  for machine learning. \\

  \noindent The US Airline Passenger dataset is shown to be well suited for 
  graph machine learning. The reasons for its success are in line with the 
  previous discussion regarding the Bank Telemarketing data set. The attributes 
  used for the MAG model generated network structures which are in part 
  predictive for the label satisfaction of the US Airline Passenger data set. 
  This is shown when looking at the satisfaction plots in figures 
  \ref{fig:us_airline_nodes} \& \ref{fig:node2vec}. \\ 

  \noindent The graph structure alone yields poor results when looking at the 
  results shown in section \ref{section:result_n2v} using Node2Vec. Taking a 
  step back with a more generous perspective, it is nevertheless impressive that 
  an accuracy of approximately 76\% could be achieved for the training- and 
  validation dataset which only considers 2-dimensional node embeddings. This 
  however did not translate to the test graph for which the best accuracy was at 
  only approximately 58\%. In this sense, the model is only marginally more 
  successful at the classification task than randomly guessing the 
  classification. \\

  \noindent Graph Convolutional Networks also achieve a classification 
  accuracy of approximately 76\%. This result is even worse when comparing it
  to Node2Vec. The GCN considers the network structure as well as the node 
  features and should therefore be capable of outperforming Node2Vec. The GCN 
  model clearly fails here and has the serious limitation that it cannot be 
  applied in an inductive setting to unseen graphs. GCN is a breakthrough model 
  as it is one of the first successful Graph Neural Networks. Nevertheless, it 
  performed poorly for the given datasets and is surpassed in terms of 
  performance by more modern GNN methods such as GraphSage. \\

  \noindent The Final graph machine learning method tested is GraphSage. This
  method yields very good results as shown in section 
  \ref{section:graphsage_results}. GraphSage is capable of training models
  which have a test accuracy of > 94\%. The aggregation strategies used for the
  GraphSage model further are successful in the order max-pooling $\geqslant$ 
  sum-pooling > LSTM > mean. This ordering is based on the results presented in 
  section \ref{section:graphsage_results} and is confirmed by the simulation 
  results shown in section \ref{section:graphsage_simulation} and appendix
  \ref{App:sim_results}. 
  When comparing the two main aggregation strategies of interest, max-pooling 
  and sum-pooling, both methods almost yield identical test results. For the
  results shown in section \ref{section:graphsage_results} max-pooling is only 
  more successful in classifying 1 more passenger as satisfied compared to
  sum-pooling. The test results are otherwise identical as shown in tables 
  \ref{table:max_results_test} \& \ref{table:sum_results_test}. The simulation
  results with 100 experiments for both max-pooling and sum-pooling confirm,
  that max-pooling yields marginally better results for the test graph with an
  average accuracy of 93.80\% compared to 93.76\% for sum-pooling. Sum-pooling
  is however more consistent, whereas max-pooling has a larger variance 
  regarding the test accuracy. In addition, max-pooling suffered from two large 
  negative test accuracy outliers during the simulation. Sum-pooling also 
  suffered from two negative test accuracy outliers, which were however less 
  pronounced. The GraphSage results show, that semi-synthetic graphs can indeed 
  be appropriate for graph machine learning.

  \section{Graph Machine Learning Versus Standard Machine Learning}

  The overview table \ref{table:result_comparison} shows that the results using 
  GraphSage are competitive in comparison to the standard machine learning
  models. The results further confirm that the results using Node2Vec and the 
  GCN are not competitive. GraphSage is shown to be the second best method 
  behind the Random Forest classifier. The ANN model on average tends to yield 
  marginally inferior test accuracy results as shown in the simulation results 
  shown in appendix \ref{App:ann_sim}. In addition, the ANN is more prone to 
  over-fitting as shown in figure \ref{fig:ANN_fit}. With regard to the other 
  standard machine learning methods, GraphSage clearly outperformed these methods. \\

  \noindent This shows, that semi-synthetic graphs can be used for graph 
  machine learning in a competitive setting. The accuracy improvements one would 
  hope for considering the rather tedious and difficult graph generation 
  procedure is however not achieved. As shown in table 
  \ref{table:result_comparison}, a simpler method such as the Random Forest 
  Classifier consistently outperforms the GraphSage model. In addition, a
  simpler standard ANN yields very similar results as GraphSage. In machine 
  learning the principle of Occam's razor is often referred to for choosing 
  appropriate models. Following this principle, simpler models are preferred if 
  they yield similar/identical results compared to more complex methods.
  GraphSage using semi-synthetic graphs is most definitely the most complex 
  method shown in table \ref{table:result_comparison}. For that reason, certainly 
  the Random Forest Classifier is preferred as it yields better accuracies and
  is a more simple model compared to GraphSage. In addition, one could argue
  that the ANN, SVM and AdaBoost are preferential to the GraphSage model as
  well. These models are simpler with only marginally inferior results. For
  the evaluation one needs to also consider the context of the classification
  task. In a medical context, accuracies are of utmost importance where one is
  willing to use more complex methods to receive marginal accuracy improvements. 
  For the purpose of gaining customer insights, the consequences for having
  marginally higher- or lower accuracies are less severe. In such a setting,
  the principle of Occam's razor can be more fully embraced which is why the
  ANN, SVM and AdaBoost might be preferred as they are simpler and more
  practical for application in a real-world setting. This is a subjective 
  assessment and depending on the context might differ. Nevertheless, GraphSage
  yields the second best accuracies and remains a competitive model.
