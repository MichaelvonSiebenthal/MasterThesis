This chapter includes the discussion, conclusion and outlook 

The primary target of this thesis was to assess to what extent that semi-
synthetic graphs can be used for graph machine learning. This was motivated by 
the following two circumstances:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Getting access to or generating graphs which include feature data is 
        very difficult.
    \item Graph machine learning is a promising and relatively novel field. It 
        has the advantage of being able to consider both feature data and 
        relational data present in graphs/networks.
\end{enumerate}
